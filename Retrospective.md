## 2026-09-21 — Reporting depended on an unavailable local proxy

After reboot, all three Eagle services started, but the collector and Manager could not upload because their launchd environments required a local proxy that was not running. Direct Node requests to the ingestion origin succeeded. Removed the fixed proxy environment, reloaded the services, and verified successful collection, Manager reporting, realtime connection and an empty pending spool. Onboarding now specifies direct networking by default and explicit optional proxy configuration.

During recovery, registering the collector immediately after `launchctl bootout` returned error 5 while its previous registration was still being removed. Checking that the service was no longer registered before bootstrapping succeeded. Service reload instructions now require waiting for shutdown before registering again.
